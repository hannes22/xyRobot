bootloader -p SmartIO.hex -d /dev/ttyAM1 -b 115200

So that was the original Readme. Pretty short, right? Let me expand...

Fastboot is an AVR Bootloader written by Peter Dannegger. It was published on the german forum mikrocontroller.net and you can find more infos there:

H. C. Zimmerer made it possible to compile the bootloader with avr-gcc. That's what I use, you can find it in the "fastboot" folder beside this one. You can also get it here:

Andreas Butti and Ilya G. Goldber then published their Host-Software for fastboot on avrfreaks.net. I made some minor changes to the code, you can find it in here.
